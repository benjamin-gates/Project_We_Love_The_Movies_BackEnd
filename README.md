# Project - We Love the Movies (Backend)
This application includes the code that makes all of the backend server requests for the frontend application of We Love the Movies

## Context of the Project
The purpose of this project was for me to put into practice my learning of using Node.js, Express.js, Knex and PostgreSQL to set up a database and make requests to the database given different routes and requests methods.

## Technologies
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Knex.js
- JavaScript

## Features
This application allows the user to make get, delete and put requests for different routes related to a movies frontend application.

## Learnings from the Project
In this project, I learned the importance of being very cautious when setting up and running migrations using Knex. Making a mistake creating the migration can cause the developer much more time setting up the database.
